<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction </h3>
<p> Configuration Dictionary is the set of multiple criteria as configuration 
features, product states, units, manufacturing plans. This dictionaries can be 
attached to the product reference to create variants of product or for evolution of 
product. In the context of variant configuration central dictionaries are termed 
as &quot;Model&quot;. Model gives the information about all the builds created 
for a product or the product configuration managed by that model. Multiple dictionaries can be attached to a single product reference. 
Models manages the products. Multiple models can be managed by a Product Line. 
</p>
<p> Models control the unit or a range of builds created for the product. It 
helps to uniquely identify the build by assigning a unit number to each build 
across all revisions of the managed product. 
</p>
<p> In configuration central, model contains the product revision these product 
revision aggregates configuration features. Different builds, manufacturing 
plans are aggregated under model. These components can be used to configure the 
product. How different components of model are stored in database is shown in 
Fig.1.</p>

<p>All these entities are of ER type. Numeric values written at relationship shows the 
cardinality of this relationship.</p>
<p> <strong>1...* : </strong>This relationship is of type one to many. This 
means at least one object should exist. Model should have at least one product 
associated with it. To achieve this when model is created one product revision 
&quot;A&quot; is associated under it. </p>
<p> <strong>0...* : </strong> This relationship is of type many to many. This 
means multiple entities can exist, this also includes zero. Product revision can 
have zero to many configuration features under it.</p>
<p> For configuration context entity type is &quot;VPMCfgContext&quot; which 
is inherited from &quot;PLMConnection&quot; core type of IRPC. This inheritance 
is shown in 
Fig.2 : </p>

<h3> <a name="How To attach Model"></a>How to Attach Model Dictionaries</h3>
<p> This task describes how to assign a model dictionaries to existing object 
	by using properties.
	
</p>
<ol>
<li> Open the existing product structure in VPM Editor Workbench. Go to properties. 
In the 
properties dialog box select Configuration tab to specify the desired configuration 
criteria.	
 </li>
<li> Click <strong>Attach Model as Configuration Context</strong>
<img alt="" src="images/CAAConfigV6_Attach.gif"> to retrieve the 
model from database specify the search criteria in &quot;Search For model&quot; dialog box.
Select the model to be assigned and click OK. Models are created by using 
variant configuration central. Refer to Product Doc for details. Attached model is visible in the
<strong>Context</strong> section of the dialog. </li>

<li> Select criteria 
 for configuration. This criteria is used for the child 
	instances to configure. Configuration criteria is classified as variant or evolution. <table>

</tr>
</table>
<p> Table at the bottom of above dialog box represents&nbsp; the predefined 
configuration.</p>
 If user want to detach a model, then select a model from the context and click on <strong>Detach Model</strong>
<img alt="" src="images/CAAConfigV6_Dettach.gif">
<p> <strong>Note</strong>: The model dictionary will be removed from the selected product , even if
<strong>Close</strong> in <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box is clicked while 
attaching 
a model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> For details about assigning models to product structure refer to product documentation. </p>
<p> Once models are assigned to the product, it can be configured. steps for 
Configuring the product structure are given in <a href="CAAConfigTaBasicScrDescription.htm">&quot;Description&quot;[1]</a></p>

<p style="height: 39px">Configuration dictionary is the set of multiple configuration criteria which 
are used for configuring the structure. Configuration criteria consist of 
configuration features, product states, builds, manufacturing plans. These 
criteria can be used for generating variants of a product or for evolution of a 
product. Product can be configured only if model dictionaries are attached to 
it. Configuration dictionaries creates major difference between Product and 
configured product.</p>
