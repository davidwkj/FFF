<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p> Effectivity is an expression composed of configuration variables (such as options, 
specifications) combined with operators (such as AND, OR and NOT). 
It is a criteria that specifies the availability of an instance for business 
processes. This conditions could be based on either date or related objects. </p>
<p> Multiple model dictionaries can be attached to product reference. All 
attached dictionaries collectively called as &quot;Configuration Context&quot;. Each configuration of 
a reference is defined for only one single model. Product configuration is the 
unique list of features and options for a product that is ordered or selected by 
a department or a customer. But effectivity is defined at the most in the scope 
of all the models of a reference. This is represented in Fig.1 : </p>

	<tr>

	</tr>
</table>
<p> Each effectivity points to all the criteria defined in the expression using 
Semantic Relationship. &quot;Semantic Relationship enables that the object express 
facts that include their own meaning&quot; these are the special kind of relationship 
which enables applications to interpret the 
meaning from it's content. Each Effectivity contains a binary describing it's 
expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;   </p>

<h3> <a name="Hierarchy Diagram"></a>Hierarchy Diagram</h3>
<p> <strong>VPMCfgEffectivity</strong> is the PLMType for effectivity which is 
inherited from core type &quot;PLMConnection&quot;. Aim of this relationship is to 
materialize the semantic information between the PLM entities in context of a 
reference object. As shown in above diagram Effectivity is always aggregated 
under the PLM Reference in the form of PLMConnection. </p>

<h3> <a name="What"></a>What is the Effectivity ?</h3>
<p> Effectivity expression is the composed of configuration variables combined 
with logical operators. It is defined in the scope of all the attached models. </p>
<p> Generic Effectivity expression is formed of 1 Global Section, N number of 
Model Section(N -&gt; Number of attached models) and 1 change stack section.&nbsp; 
Formation of generic effectivity expression is shown in Fig.3 : </p>

	<tr>
		<td>
		<img alt="" src="images/CAACfgEffectivity_Expr01.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p> As shown in Fig.4&nbsp; Generic Effectivity Expression is divided into 3 sections : </p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>One Global Section :</strong> In this section,&nbsp;if changes are 
made under the workspace then Name of workspace is included. This sections also 
includes the History of changes&nbsp; i.e. date on which changes are promoted. 
This section is completely managed by the system. This section is present only 
in the case changes are associated&nbsp;to workspace .</li>
<li> <strong>N Model Sections </strong>: Multiple Model dictionaries can be 
attached to a product reference. This section combines effectivity in the 
context of each attached model.  </li>
<li> <strong>One Change Stack Section</strong> : This is the expression of 
applicability, if the product is modified under a change object (ECA).</li>
</ol>

<h3> <a name="How to Define"></a>How To Define the Effectivity Of an Instance</h3>
<p> Effectivity is the availability of the instance for business processes. 
Effectivity can be defined for the instance which is aggregated under the 
product reference to which the configuration dictionaries are attached. For details 
about attaching model dictionaries to the product reference refer to&nbsp;
<a href="CAAConfigTaContext.htm">&quot;Introduction to Configuration Dictionary[1]&quot;</a></p>
<p> Once desired models are attached to the product, insert the product under 
it. click on the instance for which effectivity should be defined and select 
<strong>&quot;Edit Effectivity of an Instance&quot;</strong> from the contextual menu. following 
<strong>&quot;Define 
Effectivity&quot; p</strong>anel will appear. Local area in this panel represents the local 
effectivity expression in matrix format. This matrix can be modified depending 
on the criteria selection such as product state, manufacturing plan, unit(builds) or 
configuration feature.</p>
<table>
	<caption>Fig.6 Define Effectivity Panel</caption>
	<tr>
		<td><img alt="" src="images/CAAConfigV6_4.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p> If user want to have the same effectivity for next operations (same as newly created 
product) ,enable the checkbox for &quot;Keep this Effectivity for next operations in 
session&quot;.</p>

<h3> <a name="How"></a>How To Retrieve the Effectivity Of an Instance</h3>
<p> Once effectivity is defined for an instance user can retrieve the 
effectivity by following way :</p>
<p> 1) select the instance for which effectivity should be retrieved.</p>
<p> 2) select Properties of the instance.</p>
<p> 3) From the properties window select 
&quot;Effectivity&quot; tag. </p>
<p> Effectivity for instance is shown as follows: </p>

<p>We are having dedicated usecases for Retrieving effectivity.To get XML Expression of effectivity refer to : <a href="CAACfgGetXMLExpression.htm"> Getting Effectivity XML Expression </a>

<p> Effectivity defines the availability of an instance. In the process 
which are the characteristics are available is mentioned by Effectivity 
Expression. This Expression is the combination of configuration variables and 
logical operators like AND, OR. This expression also consist of date history if 
the changes are made under the scope of workspace. This can be represented in 
the XML format. The configuration modes describes about the ways available 
to make the configured operations in authoring session. </p>
