 <h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
 <p> Features are vehicle for capturing &amp; managing engineering attributes of the 
	product. To represent certain features with enough details feature specific 
	attributes are required. These attributes defines requirement or behavior of 
	Feature. Features are classified based on the type of Product that company 
	develops as Below :
	<ul> 
	 <li> <strong>Configuration Features :</strong>&nbsp; It represents the Higher-Level marketing 
	requirement and configuring options.</li>
     <li> <strong>Logical Structures :</strong>&nbsp; It includes the Logical Features &amp; 
    Manufacturing Features. Logical Features include Software Features which are 
    used to generate the BOM, While Manufacturing Feature defines 
    how the product is to be manufactured. </li>
	</ul>
<p> classification of feature is explained in Fig.1 </p>

<h3><a name="Classification"></a>Classification Of&nbsp; Configuration Features</h3>
<p> 

Configuration Features are further classified into :</p>
<ul> 
<li style="height: 13px"> <strong>Configuration Feature</strong> : It addresses 
the Marketing Requirement. e.g. Fuel capacity and type of fuel are the 
configuration feature for engine. </li>
<li><strong>Configuration Option</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; : It defines the actual choices available under the configuration Feature. These are Leaf - Level Choices 
available in specific feature to configure the product and cannot be further 
broken down.&nbsp; e.g. When fuel type is configuration feature,available 
configuration options are Petrol, Diesel etc . If fuel capacity is configuration 
feature, configuration options are 35L, 40L etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Feature Lifecycle"></a>Feature Lifecycle</h3> 
<p> Configuration Features goes through following lifecycle stages :</p>
      <ul> 
      <li> <strong>Preliminary</strong> : This state defines the 
		initial condition for a feature object. Users with a Product 
		Manager or System Engineer role are most likely to define the 
		configuration feature composition while it is in this state.</li>
      <li> <strong>Review</strong> :&nbsp; Configuration features 
		are promoted to this state upon initial composition definition.The Responsible Design Organization (RDO) governs 
		all role definitions in this state, and role definitions have RDO 
		filters in their policy. User/ Design engineer can use defined feature 
		only if it is in review state. </li>
      <li> <strong>Release</strong> : Configuration features are 
		promoted to this state using the change control behavior of the 
		Engineering Change object. You cannot manually promote or demote from 
		this state, which is considered a frozen state for the configuration 
		feature. It is not possible to make any change to the composition of a 
		configuration feature when it is in this state; however, it is still 
		possible to define a GBOM. The configuration feature is not governed by 
		the RDO when it is in this state.</li>
      <li> <strong>Obsolete</strong> : Configuration features are 
		promoted to this state using the change control behavior of the engineering 
		change object. You cannot manually promote or demote from 
		this state, which is considered a frozen state for the configuration 
		feature. It is also not possible to make any change to the composition 
		of a configuration feature when it is in this state. The configuration 
		feature is not governed by the RDO when it is in this state.
		</ul>

<h3> <a name="How to Create"></a>How To Create Configuration Feature</h3>
<p> You can create the configuration features by following steps : </p>
<ul>
We can create a stand-alone configuration feature that can be reused across multiple contexts using the 
add existing option.</li>
<li>To create a configuration feature in the context of a product, product line, product variant, product version, or configuration feature, 
from the Configuration feature page select the desired context object, click <strong>Enable Edit</strong>, then from the 
<strong>Actions</strong> menu, select &quot;Create Configuration Feature&quot;.</li>
<li>In the context of a model, from the configuration features page, on the 
candidate configuration features tab, from the page actions menu, select &quot;Create 
Configuration Feature&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p> Detailed description of creating feature refer to product documentation.</p>

<h3> <a name="Navigation"></a>Navigation in Product Structure</h3>
<p>Configuration features are associated with the product revision. Different 
product can share same configuration features and options. Configuration feature 
are used as variant criteria. </p>
<p>In case of manufacturing plans this is not the case, same manufacturing plan 
cannot be used for different products. Therefore it is aggregated under the model. 
Manufacturing plans are used as evolution criteria. </p>
<p>The structure of various features in context of model is explained in Fig.2 :</p>

<h3> Configuration Feature : Variant Criteria</h3>
<p> Configuration is the process of&nbsp; managing the variants. This is achieved by using 
configuration 
feature. Each product is having multiple features( characteristics) by using 
this features multiple variants can be created. </p>

<p> Configuration Options are aggregated under the configuration features. Configuration 
options stores actual information about characteristics of product. </p>
<p> e.g. while manufacturing car, engine is a commonly used product. There are 
different types of engine depending on the type of fuel. so for car &quot;Fuel 
Type&quot; will be treated as the configuration feature. Actual values for the 
type are  Petrol,Diesel(values are depending on the model and country) so these 
values are treated as configuration options for engine fuel. </p>
<p> In this case, different variants for car are : CAR Eng. Fuel-Petrol, CAR Eng. Fuel-Diesel</p>

<h3><a name="In Short"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>Configuration Feature achieves the management of product variants. 
Manufacturing plans/ features are used as evolution criteria. This is the 
essential component as it makes possible to generate the different variants of 
product. It can exist as stand-alone object or the object in the context of some 
product or model.</p>
