  A customizable grouping of data created by displaying properties from one or more related database classes.   Context consists of a set of dictionaries defining the criteria that can be used to configure the structure. e.g. Multiple views, also known as forms, for a screen may be constructed based on user organization preferences and requirements.</td>

	 <tr> 
	 <td valign="top" class="style2" style="width: 225px"> Configuration Feature</td>
	 <td class="style2"> A type of ENOVIA feature that addresses marketing requirements. The 
		Configuration Features area contains the configuration options 
		associated with the product states to the product revision of the model.
		<br>
		When this configuration criteria type is applied on the parent 
		reference, the Configuration Features area is available. You can select 
		the configuration features from the Configuration Features area and the 
		Local area is populated with your selections.<br>
		Configuration Features allowing multiple selected values is symbolized 
		as and Configuration Features allowing only one selected value is 
		symbolized as . This information is displayed in both Criteria and

	 <td class="style2"> A set of process steps that describe how an assembly is manufactured. 
		The Manufacturing Plans area contains the different manufacturing plan 
		created for the model. When this configuration criteria type is applied 
		on the parent reference, the Manufacturing Plans area is available. You 
		can select the manufacturing plans from the Manufacturing Plans area and

		Defines the different unit numbers that are built for a given product.</td></tr>

	 <tr> 
	 <td valign="top" class="style2" style="width: 225px"> Product States</td>
	 <td class="style2"> The Product States area contains the different product revisions 
		created for the model. It defines the different stages of the 
		configuration definition for a given product. This is Part of a 
		lifecycle that determines who can access and perform specific tasks on 
		an object. A CAD object usually goes through these states in its 
		lifecycle: Preliminary, Review, Approved, Release.<br>
		When this configuration criteria type is applied on the parent 
		reference, the Product States area is used for selecting the criteria. 
		The Local area available under the Expression section is populated with 
		your selections. <br>
		<br>
		Note: If this configuration criteria type is not applied on the parent 
		reference, the Product States area is still available and used as a 
		filter for the availability of other criteria. In this scenario, the 
		Product States cannot be added in the Local effectivity, but are only 
		used to filter the available Configuration features. </td></tr>

	 <td valign="top" class="style2" style="width: 225px"> Product Revision</td>
	 <td class="style2"> In ENOVIA Product Line Management, a change to the original product,

	 <td class="style2"> A criteria that specifies the availability of an instance for business 
		processes. The conditions could be based on either date or related 
		objects. It is an expression composed of configuration variables (such

		AND, OR and NOT). There are two types of Effectivity : 1) Inherited 2) 
		Local</td></tr>

	 <tr> 
	 <td valign="top" class="style2" style="width: 225px"> Local Area</td>
	 <td class="style2"> The Local area lists the local effectivity expression in matrix 
		format. This matrix can be modified depending on the criteria selection 
		such as Product State, Manufacturing Plan, Unit or Configuration 
		Feature. One or more configuration options are available for each 
		configuration feature. </td></tr>

	 <td valign="top" class="style2" style="width: 225px"> Expression</td>
	 <td class="style2"> An object (persistent or not) used to describe with a text an
