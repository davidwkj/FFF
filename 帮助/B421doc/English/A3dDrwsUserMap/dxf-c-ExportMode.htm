    </p>

      <p><span class="uicontrol">Graphic</span>: This mode is quick and reliable. It is
useful if you want to export a drawing to AutoCAD and print it
without modifying it.</p><p><span class="uicontrol">Semantic</span>: <ul><li>The exported file can be modified.</li>
<li>Dimensions are exported as subfigures and are editable as such. Dimensions that cannot be exported semantically are exported as
subfigures. </li>
<li>Half-dimensions and  chamfer dimensions are exported as
subfigures.</li>
<li>Circular, linear and angular dimensions are exported as true
dimensions and editable as such.</li>
<li>The texts of those dimensions are exported with the STANDARD
style and the isocp.shx font.</li>
<li>The tolerances of dimensions are exported.</li>
<li>The 2D labels are exported.</li>
<li>The "upper" and "down" texts are not taken into account.</li>
<li>Dual values are not exported.</li>
<li>Circular extension lines are not exported.</li>
<li>Show/No Show:
The <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> elements placed in the No Show are not exported. The visible
elements are exported.</li>
<li>
Layers are automatically exported.</li>
<li>To avoid missing geometries at export, we recommend that you
activate either the filter All Visible or the filter None.</li>
<li>Texts:
<ul>
<li>All texts are exported as texts (even dimension texts and
annotations) with a fit justification.</li>

<li>All texts are exported with the STANDARD style and the
isocp.shx font with the exception of geometric tolerance symbols
that are exported with the GDT specific style and gdt.shx font,
with the corresponding mapping.</li>

<li>The symbols for diameter, 
degree and plus/minus 
are inserted with the
standard tags.</li>

<li>Unicode characters are exported with the 
\U+ 
tag.
You have to redefine the STANDARD style in AUTOCAD to reference an
unicode font.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p><p>Note:
		For both modes:<ul><li>If the sheet to export contains no geometry, or only non
supported entities, no DXF/DWG file is generated.</li>
<li>The visual clipping of views is not supported.</li>
<li>The point of view (camera) of the model is not exported.

<div><p>If you have selected the semantic mode, specific options become available.</p>
<div class="section" id="c-SemanticOptions__cs-ExportdimensionsasDimensions"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Export dimensions as Dimensions</h3><a name="ix-DXF/DWG::export dimensions as dimensions"> </a>If the <span class="uicontrol">Export dimensions as Dimensions</span> check box is not selected, all dimensions are
exported as graphic blocks and are editable as such.<p>If the <span class="uicontrol">Export dimensions as Dimensions</span> check box is
selected, dimensions are exported as follows:<ul>
<li>The graphic representation is always created in addition to the
semantic representation. Thus when opening the result with semantic
dimensions with AutoCAD, the graphic representation is first kept
but the dimension may be rebuilt at any edition, while taking into
account the default dimension style.</li>

<li>Default dimension style entails that most graphic attributes
(such as color, display format of the dimension value, type of
arrow, space...) of the dimensions are lost. The default dimension
style depends on the current export unit (INCH, mm,...).</li>

<li>Horizontal and Vertical projected linear dimensions are created
as DXF "rotated dimensions".
If the attach points of the dimension are distant compared to the
projected distance, there may be a numerical error in the measured
dimension.
If this occurs, reduce the number of digits displayed in the
opening system.</li>

</ul>
</p></div>
<div class="section" id="c-SemanticOptions__cs-ExportBlocks"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Export Blocks</h3><p><a name="ix-DXF/DWG::export blocks"> </a>Those three options define how blocks are exported:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">None</span>: The export does not create any block in the DXF/DWG file. </li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">One level</span>: Details are retrieved through their Dittos. A Detail not referenced
by a Ditto is thus lost, a Detail referenced by several Dittos is
duplicated in BLOCKS. The entities included in a Detail are not
structured into sub-blocks.
The graphical representation of each Ditto is exported to an
INSERT/BLOCK.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Full</span>: Each Detail instantiated by a Ditto
inside a sheet is translated as such. If necessary, the name
of the Detail changes according to the following rule:<ul><li>If the <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> Detail name is an empty string, the name of the corresponding BLOCK is <span class="uicontrol">BLOCK_EMPTY_NAME_</span> followed by a number to guarantee the
uniqueness of the name (whatever the <span class="uicontrol">Version</span> might be).</li>
<li>If the <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> Detail name is not en empty string, and if <span class="uicontrol">Version </span>is set to <span class="uicontrol">DXF/DWG R12/R13/R14</span>, only the first 20 characters are exported (f required, they are followed by an underscore '_' and a number to
guarantee the uniqueness of the name). The only characters exported
are letters (from 'a' to 'b' and from 'A' to 'Z') all converted in
upper case, digits (from '0' to '9') and the following special
characters: the hyphen '-' and the underscore '_'. All others
characters are exported as underscore '_'.</li>
<li>If the <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> Detail name is not en empty string, and if <span class="uicontrol">Version </span>is set to <span class="uicontrol">DXF/DWG 2000</span> or higher, only the first 250 characters are exported (if required, they are
followed by an underscore '_' and a number to guarantee the
uniqueness of the name (with the same constraint about characters
as above except that lower case letters are not modified in
uppercase letters).</li>
</ul>


<p>Details which are not directly
defined inside the Drawing representation (e.g. coming from a catalog) are exported as one
INSERT/BLOCK per Ditto visually faithful.</p>

<p> For each supported Detail:<ul><li>Ditto is
positioned inside the Sheet coordinates system according its insertion
point and its transformation.</li>
<li>The graphical
properties (color, line type, line thickness) of each Ditto are visually kept (no overload will be seen).</li>
<li>The Detail entities
keep their layer according to the DXF layer semantic export option
(the name or the number is exported).</li>
<li>Contained geometric entities like Nurbs, Spline or ellipse are exported semantically (not as polylines).</li>
<li>Nested Detail are exported as such.</li>
<li>Invisible entities are not exported.</li>
<li>Only the Detail instantiated
inside the sheet are exported.</li>
<li>The number of exported entities is written in the report file. One export Detail corresponds to only one BLOCK with as many INSERTS as exported Dittos.</li>

is defined by three data:<ul>
<li>Its number</li>

<li>An optional name</li>

<li>An optional comment</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>In AutoCAD applications, layers are defined by:<ul>
<li>A name</li>

<li>A status</li>

<li>Some graphical attributes.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>You can choose how you want to export layer number:<ul>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Export layer number</span>:
Each <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> layer is exported with an AutoCad layer name that is the
number of the <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> layer</li>

<li><span class="uicontrol">Export layer name</span><ul>
<li>If the <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> layer name is an empty string, the <span><span class="tm-3D">3D</span>EXPERIENCE</span> number is
exported (whenever the AutoCAD export version chosen).</li>

<li>If AutoCAD R12, R13 or R14 is selected as the export version,
then only the first 26 characters are exported.
The only characters exported are: 

<ul>
<li>Letters (from 'a' to 'b' and from 'A' to 'Z') all converted in
upper case</li>

<li>Digits (from '0' to '9')</li>

<li>And the following special characters: the hyphen '-' and the
underscore '_'</li>

<li>All others characters are exported as underscore '_'.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>If AutoCAD 2000 or a version above is selected as the export
version, then only the first 255 characters are exported, with the
same constraint about characters as above, except that lower case
letters are not changed to uppercase letters and space character is
authorized.</li>

<li>Some different layers could be translated into the same AutoCAD
Layer. When this case happens a message is added inside the report
file.</li>
