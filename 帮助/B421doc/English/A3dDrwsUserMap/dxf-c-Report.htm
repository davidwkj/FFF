            using an ISO standard (or vice-versa). Select the required Drawing standard. </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Inconsistency between the import of dimensions with the semantic
preserving option (Convert dimensions as: Dimensions)
and the import of dimensions with the graphic preserving option
(Convert dimensions as: Details or Geometry</dt>
<dd><a name="ix-DXF/DWG::semantic vs graphic"> </a>This is generally due to an inconsistency in the DXF/DWG file
itself (the aspect is different in AUTOCAD14 and AUTOCAD2000). This happens with files that have not been generated with AUTOCAD.

Usually, the graphic mode should be used, but only the author of
the file can confirm it.
The DXF/DWG file contains both data:<ul>
<li>The semantic data is the definition of the dimension: its
attach points and all the properties of the value, text, line,
leaders, …, most of them inherited from the dimension style.</li>

<li>The graphic data is the resulting representation of the
dimension, composed with lines, arcs, texts, gathered in an
internal block.</li>

</ul>


<p>Most of the time, the graphic and semantic data are consistent
but nothing in the DXF/DWG format can insure that.
The DXF import option lets you choose the data to use during the
import.

A way to check that the inconsistency comes from the DXF/DWG file
itself is to open it in DraftSight. The graphic representation is
first displayed. When pointing a dimension and moving slightly a
point for example, the graphic representation is recomputed from
the semantic data and may be completely different from the original
one.</p>

directly by AutoCAD but by an application based on AutoCAD, e.g.
AutoCAD Mechanical.
This application manages applicative objects that are not included
in the standard DXF format. These objects can be edited and
manipulated only by the application that generated them, but for a
compatibility purpose, a graphic representation can be associated
to this object. This associated representation is optional and is
named a Proxy (type ACAD_PROXY_ENTITY). During import the proxy is
converted into a graphic block that is imported as a <span><span>Drawings</span></span>
detail instantiated at the place of the proxy. It can be edited
like any detail.
