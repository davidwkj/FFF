	 provides a simple method to manipulate a sheet. A sheet contains: 
  <ul> 
	 <li>A main view which supports the geometry directly
		created in the sheet. 
	 </li>
 
	 <li>A background view dedicated to frames and title
		blocks. 
	 </li>
 
	 <li>Interactive or generated views. 
	 </li>
 
  </ul>
 
  </p> 
  <p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li>When 
		<span class="uicontrol">Paper Spaces in
		  Background</span> is selected, the data lying on the paper spaces are put
		in the background view of the layout sheet. The viewports are created in the
		working view. 
	 </li>
 
	 <li>When 
		<span class="uicontrol">Paper Spaces in
		  Background</span> is not selected, the data lying on the paper spaces are
		put in a new auxiliary view of the sheet. This auxiliary view is visible in the
		3D. You can change the view support for auxiliary views 
	 </li>
 
  </ul>
 
  <ul> 
	 <li>When 
		<span class="uicontrol">Keep Model
		  Space</span> is not selected: 
		<ul> 
		  <li>When the model space is referenced by no
			 viewport (or if there is no viewport in the imported file), it is created in
			 its own sheet (unless it is empty). 
		  </li>
 
		  <li>When the model space is referenced at least
			 partially by one or several viewports, it is not created in its own sheet. Only
			 layouts are created. They contain eventual viewports. The entities found
			 completely or partially in the clipping view are imported. The entities found
			 completely outside the clipping view are not imported. In this case, select 
			 <span class="uicontrol">Keep model
				space</span> to force the creation of the model space in its own sheet
			 with all its entities.
