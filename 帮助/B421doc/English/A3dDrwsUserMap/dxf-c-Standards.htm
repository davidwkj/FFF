<ul>
<li>The elements used in the mappings customized in the DXF

the consistency between the DXF/DWG interface and the

<li>Standard files apply to all the sessions using them,
thus controlling the company standard at the import process.</li>


<li>The DXF.xml file is a standard that sets the default mapping
between DXF/DWG and <span><span>Drawings</span></span> elements, for the color to thickness, line
types and text fonts.</li>
<li>The DXF.xml file is stored under<span class="filepath"> installation_folder\resources\standard\dxf</span>.<p>For multi-sites installations, we recommend that the administrator loads  the DXF.xml file in <span>Data Setup</span>, thus making sure one single standard file is available for all users in on-line mode. See <a href="pjrid1-m-PRM-sb.htm#pjrid1-m-PRM-sb" title="Data Setup is an app that you can use to associate resources to apps in projects.

the associations used during import.</li>
