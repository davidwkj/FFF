    <p>Deleting dress-up elements: <ul><li>If  you delete generated center lines, threads or axis lines, you will be able to generate them again using the <span class="uicontrol">Restore Properties</span> option from the <span>context menu</span>.</li>
<li>If you delete in 3D, the geometry on which dress-up elements are based, these dress-up elements will be permanently deleted when you update the <span class="glossterm" id="drawing" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('drawing.xml')">drawing</span> (an update operation cannot be undone). This has a consequence on existing annotations or dimensions (i.e. annotations or dimensions that were created on such a dress-up element prior to its deletion):<ul><li>Annotations will no longer be linked to anything. </li>
<li>Dimensions will appear as being not-up-to-date. Note that you can <a href="gdr3dmaster-t-Dimensions-DimensionReroute.htm#gdr3dmaster-t-Dimensions-DimensionReroute" title="You can re-route dimensions, that is recalculate dimensions taking into account new geometry elements which are compatible with the re-routed dimension type.">re-route dimensions</a> to geometry when relevant. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p><p>Moving dress-up elements: </p><p>About axis lines, center lines and threads: These dress-up cannot be moved (<span class="uicontrol">translate</span>, <span class="uicontrol">rotate</span>, <span class="uicontrol">mirror</span>, <span class="uicontrol">symmetry</span> and <span class="uicontrol">scale</span> commands) alone, because they are associative with a reference geometry. However, if their reference is moved in the same operation, or if the <span class="glossterm" id="associativity-2" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('associativity-2.xml')">associativity</span> is suppressed, these dress-up elements can be moved. For example, when isolating a view, axis lines, center lines and threads are no more associative, you can then perform the operations listed above. </p>
