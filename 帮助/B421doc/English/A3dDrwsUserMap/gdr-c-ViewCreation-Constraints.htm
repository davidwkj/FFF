    This topic provides information about constraints used in creating aligned/offset section view/cut. 
    You can constrain a section profile either by applying a directional or a positional constraint. You can also constrain a second or a higher profile segment by applying an offset constraint for offset section views and/or cuts. You can define an offset constraint with respect to a hole, a generated line, one of the coordinates axis of the sheet,  as well as a sketched line as a reference element for aligned as well as offset section views and/or cuts.

  <div>
    <ul><li>Directional constraint: A directional constraint is the one which constrains the direction of the profile segment. This can be achieved either through the parallel, perpendicular or angle constraint functionality.<p>When such a constraint is applied, the position of the profile segment is defined by the starting point of the selected profile segment, but the directional constraint is applied according to the selected directional constraint.</p>  <ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Parallel</span>: The <span class="glossterm" id="section-profile" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('section-profile.xml')">section profile</span> is created parallel to the selected reference element and passing through the first point. This constraint is active by default. </li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Perpendicular</span>: The section profile is created perpendicular to the selected reference element and passing through the first point.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Angle</span>: The section profile is created at the specified angle, in a counter-clockwise direction relatively to the selected line. When this constraint is selected, the <span class="uicontrol">Angle</span> box appears, that lets you enter the required angle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Positional constraint: A positional constraint is the one which constrains the position of the profile segment, along with the direction. This is achieved through the offset constraint functionality. When an offset constraint is applied, the starting point of the profile segment is recomputed in order to fix the position of the profile segment at the specified distance from the reference element.<p><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Offset</span>: The section profile is created with the specified offset, parallel to the selected reference element (on the same side as the reference element in the case of a positive value, on the opposite side in the case of a negative value).  When this constraint is selected, the <span class="uicontrol">Offset</span> box appears, that lets you enter the required offset value.</li>
