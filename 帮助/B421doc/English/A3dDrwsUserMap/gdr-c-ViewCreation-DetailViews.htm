      Miscellaneous Remarks About Quick Detail Views and Quick Detail View Profiles
    </h2>

    
    <div><p><span>This sub-topic makes 
    miscellaneous remarks about quick detail views and sketched quick detail profiles.</span>

      </p>

       <ul> <li>If the view which defines the sketched quick detail profiles is modified, the quick detail view is simultaneously updated.</li>
 <li>If the view which defines the  sketched quick detail profiles is removed, the quick detail view recovers its original definition.</li>
 <li>The view update may be quicker in some cases (depending on the geometry contained in the view which defines the quick detail profile).</li>
 <li>The whole detail profile is always drawn in the quick detail view.</li>
 <li>A side <span class="glossterm" id="representation" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('representation.xml')">representation</span> of threads is available only if threads are first generated in the view which defines the quick detail view.</li>
 <li>Avoid creating a quick detail view from an <span class="glossterm" id="aligned-section-view" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('aligned-section-view.xml')">aligned section view</span>/cut as it may result in wrongly generated axis lines.</li>
 </ul>
 
    <p>The quick detail view is updated as a standalone view in the following cases:<ul><li>The view which defines the  sketched quick detail profiles is locked or not up-to-date.</li>
<li>The quick detail view projection mode is different from the projection mode of the view which defines the quick detail profile (i.e. “exact” vs. “approximate”).</li>
<li>	The view which defines the quick detail view is already a detail/quick detail view or already owns a clipping/quick clipping specification. Therefore, you cannot create a clipping/quick clipping view profile on a detail/quick detail view.</li>
</ul>

<div class="nested1" id="c-DetailViewProfileAssociativity"><p><map name="FPMap1"><area href="#hj-top" title="Back to Top" shape="rect" coords="416, 0, 435, 10"/></map><img border="0" src="../IconsReference/butix_top_wline.png" width="436" height="11" usemap="#FPMap1"/></p><h2 class="topictitle2"> Detail View Profiles Associativity</h2>

<div><p><span>You can create a detail view profile associative to a 3D geometry, so that even if the geometry is moved, modified or set to the hidden mode, the detail profile will remain associative to the 3D geometry. However, if the associated 3D geometry is deleted, the associativity will be lost.</span>
</p>
<p>To create an associative detail profile, you need to:</p><p><ol><li>Sketch the required detail profile.</li>
<li>Select a 2D generative edge in the defining view. </li>
<li>Select a point to denote the location of the resulting detail view.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>You need to select the reference 2D generative element to apply the <span class="glossterm" id="associativity-2" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('associativity-2.xml')">associativity</span> prior to denoting  the location at which the resultant detail view is desired to be created. The associativity is created between the corresponding 3D <span class="glossterm" id="object" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('object.xml')">object</span> on the 3D edge/face representing the selected 2D generative element and the starting point of the detail profile.</p><p>As soon as the associativity is created, a message appears in the top right corner of the screen  informing  that an associative detail profile has been created. This message disappears automatically once you indicate the location of the resultant detail view by clicking at the appropriate location in the <span class="glossterm" id="sheet" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('sheet.xml')">sheet</span>.</p>
<p>The resultant detail view is associative to the 3D geometry corresponding to the selected 2D generative element. Therefore, if you modify this associated 3D geometry, that modification will be reflected in the resultant detail view when the defining view and the detail view are updated. However, if this 3D object is deleted or not loaded in the session, the associativity will be lost.</p><p><table class="Remark" id="table132"><tr><td class="Remark"><span class="run-in">Important:
				</span>Only a 2D generative edge\face in the defining view is considered as a valid reference element to define the associativity. If you select any other element in the defining view, it will not be considered as a valid input and no associativity will be created in such a case.</td></tr></table>

<div><p><span>If you modify the graphic dress-up properties of detail operator profile lines in the detail view, they remain persistent even after updating the view and get applied to all the  remaining profile lines of that detail view.</span>
 <table class="Remark" id="table132"><tr><td class="Remark"><span class="run-in">Important:

 </p>
<p>If you select any profile line  of a detail operator profile in the detail view, and modify its graphic properties such as color, linetype, linethickness, delete, layer and hide/show, and update the view or use <samp class="codeph">c:force update</samp>, then all the remaining profile lines of that detail operator in that detail view are assigned with  the new graphic dress-up properties.</p><p>Note:
		The graphic properties of the detail operator profile lines in detail view modified through the <span class="uicontrol"> Properties </span>or through the <span class="uicontrol">Graphic Properties</span>,  take precedence over overloading of the graphic properties from <span class="uicontrol">XXX object &gt; Overload Properties</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="c-GraphPropsDetailViews__cs-SwitchingBetweenExactandApproximateViewModes"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Switching Between Exact and Approximate View Modes</h3><p><ul><li>The graphic dress-up properties for the operators are maintained independently for Exact and Approximate view modes. Therefore, if you switch between these two view modes, you can visualize the latest set of modified graphic dress-up properties for those particular operator profile lines in that particular view mode. However, if there is no last modification available for those operator profile lines for that view mode, then the default properties set in the standard for that operator in that view mode are seen.</li>
<li>For example, you can assign one set of graphic dress-up values for the detail operator in <span class="glossterm" id="exact-view" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('exact-view.xml')">exact view</span> mode and another set of graphic dress-up values for the same detail operator in approximate view mode. When you switch between exact and approximate view modes, you can visualize the profile lines of that same detail operator differently.</li>

<div class="section" id="c-GraphPropsDetailViews__cs-EditingTheDetailOperatorProfile"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Editing the Detail Operator Profile</h3><p>Graphic dress-up properties assigned to profile lines of a detail operator are retained even after performing edition of the same operator.</p></div>
