<p>To avoid such clashes and ensure that the edge representing the border of the collision will be projected, you can modify the assembly or part using either of the following methods: </p><ul><li>Move the parts or bodies in such a way that the clash will be avoided.</li>
<li>If possible, use Boolean operations (such as <span class="uicontrol">Add</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Remove</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Intersect</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Assemble</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Union Trim</span> in Part Design) to generate a single body resulting from the intersection.</li>

Then, on the part instance associated to the screw, you must perform either of the following:</p><ul>
           <li>From the 3D part, set its property to <span class="uicontrol">No cut</span>.

<div><p><span>CGR views are generated using the CGR format (CATIA Graphical Representation) of the 3D geometry. 
     A CGR format only contains a graphical representation of the geometry, which 
     is available with the Visualization mode (as opposed to the exact geometry, 
     which is available with the Design mode). The CGR view uses and displays only 
     the external appearance of the component and  the geometry is not available. The 
     corresponding .cgr file, if it exists, is inserted from the cache system. 
     </span>
<a name="ix-CGR views"> </a><a name="ix-views::generating CGR views"> </a></p>

     
     <p>To generate a correct CGR view from an assembly composed of .cgr files, 
     use only the high quality .cgr files, containing data about edges and faces. For 
     example, a .cgr file created with DMU Optimizer misses this information (to be 
     as light as possible). In this particular case, the CGR view mode can produce 
     unpredictable results.</p>
     <p>CGR views are not as high in quality as exact views, but they consume much 
     less memory during the generation. This may be useful when dealing with sophisticated 
     products or assemblies involving large amounts of data. However, this generation 
     mode is rather slow. </p>

     the CGR generation mode, see

     Advantages and Restrictions Common to CGR and Approximate</h2>
<div><p>Using CGR or Approximate to generate views offers the following advantages:
     </p>

     
     <ul>
       <li>Optimize memory consumption when generating and handling projection views 
       for large products or assemblies. </li>

       <li>Generate views from third-party data (such as MultiCAD), as well as from 
       polyhedral elements (such as dittos, surfaces, etc.) in V4 .model documents.
        
       Be careful in using only the high quality .cgr files, containing data about edges 
       and faces. For example, a .cgr file created with DMU Optimizer misses this 
       information (to be as light as possible). In this particular case, the CGR 
       and Approximate view modes can produce unpredictable results.</li>

     </ul>

     <p>However, the CGR or Approximate generation mode involves a number of restrictions:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>You cannot generate the following types of views:<ul>
         <li>For CGR: section views, section cuts, detail views, detail view profile, 
         breakout views, <span class="glossterm" id="unfolded-view" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('unfolded-view.xml')">unfolded views</span> and views from 3D. </li>

         <li>For Approximate: detail views, detail view profile, unfolded views 
         and views from 3D. </li>

       </ul>

       </li>

       <li>The following types of elements are not associative on CGR or Approximate 
       views:<ul>
         <li>For CGR: <span class="glossterm" id="auxiliary-view" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('auxiliary-view.xml')">Auxiliary view</span> profiles, annotations, dimensions, etc.</li>

         <li>For Approximate: Auxiliary view profiles, annotations, etc.  
         Dimensions may now be associative, depending on whether you select the
         <span class="uicontrol">Allow the creation of associative dimension in approximate views</span> 
         option in the <span class="uicontrol">Dimensions associativity</span> on 3D dialog box (see
         <a href="../PreferencesMap/gdrpref-c-Dimension.htm#gdrpref-c-Dimension" title="You can customize dimension options for Drafting using this section. You can customize options for positioning a dimension, line-up a dimension during its creation. You can also define the way a dimension is moved, default parameters to line-up a dimension and so on.">Dimension</a> options).</li>

       </ul>

       </li>

       <li>You cannot project 3D elements such as wireframe, points, etc. on CGR 
       or Approximate views.</li>

       <li>CGR or Approximate views cannot contain dress-up elements (axis, center 
       lines, threads).</li>

       <li>Persistency of graphical properties edition (color, line type, line thickness, 
       no show) and Delete operations performed on generated elements are not available 
       on CGR views but available on approximate views. However, as approximate views are based on the 3D representation (instead of the 3D topology for Exact Views) the <span class="glossterm" id="associativity-2" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('associativity-2.xml')">associativity</span> is limited. Therefore, if you modify a subpart of your 3D design, then the corresponding 2D representation will lose any graphical changes that may have been made on it.</li>

       <li>
       CGR or Approximate views being only a graphical representation 
       of the geometry, only line segments are generated in such views. In  case 
       of non-associative dimensions (as is always the case for CGR views, and may 
       be the case for Approximate views when the <span class="uicontrol">Allow the creation of associative 
       dimension in approximate views</span> check box is not selected), the only elements 
       that can be dimensioned are these line segments.  
       As a result, you may not be able create certain types of radius or diameter 
       dimensions in such views.
       </li>

       <li>
       <span class="uicontrol">CGR</span> or the <span class="uicontrol">Approximate</span> option disables 
       a number of other options on the <span class="uicontrol">View</span> and on the <span class="uicontrol">Generation</span> 
       tab (available through <span>
				<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Me <img src="../Icons22/IP_TopBarProfile.png"/>

       or in the <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span> dialog box (available by right-clicking the view and selecting <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span>).
       </li>

       <li>Approximate items cannot be selected using the mouse (trap selection). 
       However you can click
       <img src="../IconsNormal/I_Select.png"/> to 
       select and edit the properties of a single item. Note that you can also multi-select 
       several items using the 
       <span class="uicontrol">Ctrl</span> 
       key.
       
       </li>

       <li>
       Approximate items cannot be duplicated. The <span class="uicontrol">Duplicate</span> 
       command is not available using <span>context menu</span> on an approximate item.
       </li>
<li>Approximate items cannot be searched using the <span class="uicontrol">Find</span> command. They cannot be filtered by their graphical properties such as, linetype, color, thickness, etc. </li>

       <li>
       The mesh thickness has an impact on the CGR and approximate 
       view performance. Moreover, a CGR view cannot be computed from an extremely 
       thin mesh, i.e. when the mesh on a single face consists of more than 6500 
       triangles. In this special case, you must raise the 3D accuracy (through
            <span>

			</span><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol"> &gt; Display</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Performance</span></span> section, under <span class="uicontrol">3D Accuracy</span>) before projecting 
       a CGR view.
       </li>

     </ul>

     <p>As a consequence of these restrictions, selecting either the <span class="uicontrol">CGR</span> 
     or the <span class="uicontrol">Approximate</span> option disables a number of other options on 
     the <span class="uicontrol">View</span> and on the <span class="uicontrol">Generation</span> tab (available through
