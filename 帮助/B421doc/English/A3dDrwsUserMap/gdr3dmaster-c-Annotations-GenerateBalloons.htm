<li>If the command is used twice on the same view, new balloons are generated on the parts, irrespective of whether balloons already exist on the parts (either automatically generated or manually added) or not. In this case, the balloons are also generated on the newly added parts/products in the product structure represented in the view. However, it is possible to use one of the two options <span class="uicontrol">Update</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Reset</span> to avoid having duplicated balloons.</li>
<li>The balloons that were automatically generated, but manually deleted are created again  provided that the product they are attached to is still in the corresponding BOM.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>	Once created, the balloons are positioned automatically according to the position of the ballooned part in the view.</p>  </div>

<li>If one or several parts seen in the view are not in the BOM (for example, balloons for phantom products that are not listed in the referenced BOM), the balloons will show a number that is increased as the balloons are created.  However, content of these balloons does not change associatively because they do not have their respective part/product <span class="glossterm" id="representation" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('representation.xml')">representation</span> in the BOM. </li>
<li>If there is one or several bills of material in the drawing that point to a different root product from that of the view or that are isolated, then the balloons show a number that is increased as the balloons are created (1,2,...,N).</li>

<dd>You can use <span class="uicontrol">Update</span> in a view where balloons have previously been created and if you select the same associated BOM and its creation options.<p>When using <span class="uicontrol">Update</span>, if a phantom product that was previously listed in the BOM is no longer listed in it because of a change of BOM format, and if you do not select the <span class="uicontrol">Show Phantom Products</span> option, then its balloon is updated with a <span class="uicontrol">?</span> symbol to indicate that the content is no longer valid. Otherwise, its number is changed to an incremented number.</p><p>Likewise, if you select the <span class="uicontrol">Show Phantom Products</span> option:<ul><li>If an N-line BOM becomes an N+X-line BOM (when a product is added in the product structure), and if a phantom product that was not listed in the referring N-line BOM is ballooned with number N+1, its content is updated to N+X+1. </li>
<li>If an N-line BOM becomes an N-X-line BOM (when a product is removed in the product structure), and if a phantom product that was not listed in the referring N-line BOM is ballooned with number N+1, its content is updated to N-X+1.</li>
<li>The BOM used as a reference for the balloons can also be preselected before clicking on the <span class="uicontrol">Automatic Balloons Generation</span> command. In this case, the selected BOM is automatically displayed in the <span class="uicontrol">BOM</span> list of  <span class="uicontrol">Automatic Ballooning Options</span> dialog box. However, if required, you can change this selection by choosing another BOM in the <span class="uicontrol">BOM</span> list.</li>
