<p>A BOM describes a product in terms of its assemblies, sub-assemblies and/or basic parts. It consists of an itemized list of parts of a structure shown on a <span class="glossterm" id="drawing" onmouseout="hideTerm()" onmouseover="showTerm('drawing.xml')">drawing</span> or a layout in the shape of a table.
    
  There are different types of bills of materials depending upon the discipline that generates them and the purpose for which they are intended. You can customize a BOM by choosing its type, style, properties and so on.
